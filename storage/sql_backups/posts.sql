Where do you go? What happens if it\'s at night and you and your family are asleep? Read these overview instructions to help make you more prepared for these scary weather events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Daytime Storm Warnings</h2>\r\n<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Phasellus a nisi vel ipsum laoreet mollis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nighttime Storm Warnings</h2>\r\n<p>Night time storms are perhaps probably the scariest as the majority of us are sleeping. What should you do to prepare yourself for one of these unfortunate events should it occur? The first and most important thing to do is to have a plan in place. Think of it like a fire drill. A fire at night is a very scary event as you wake up to a sounding alarm and have just seconds to realize what is happening and react accordingly. The difference is that most of us (especially with family) have some sort of action plan in place. Get up, get out, and meet at area x. We should have the same routine, especially for those who live in tornado prone areas, to practice as we do with fire alarms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a warning is issued (thankfully modern technology has given us much more response time today than ever before), get your family and get to a storm "safe" meeting area, whether a storm cellar, a special place in a basement, or some sort of area that you have deemed the best place to wait out a storm. A storm kit should probably include at least two days worth of emergency supplies - such as water, batteries, canned/non-perishable food (and of course a flashlight and NOAA battery powered radio), to name a couple. This is a plan that should be practiced just like with fire alarm testing. Simulate these storm scenarios with everyone in your household just as you would a fire alarm. The habit and reactionary response it will build could one day save your life, just as it would if a fire was to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p>Safety is everything and with these storms, it can be a real challenge, especially if they are at night. So have a storm safety plan in place and practice it. These habits could very well be the one thing that no matter how much you may feel may never happen, and hey, let\'s hope it never does, could save you and your family\'s lives. Be sure to keep your storm safety kit up to date and keep a battery operated NOAA radio handy as these monsters can strike not just at any time, but any where in the US and Canada. Check out <a href="http://www.weather.com">The Weather Channel</a>\'s website as you will find a lot of guide lines to preparing a storm safety kit with a lot of valuable information on what to do should disaster strike your area.</p>', 'When-a-Tornado-Strikes', 1, '2016-07-15 00:28:01', '2016-07-15 00:28:01'),

The test will be a demonstration to show the effectiveness of the OPWS in transforming the Boston Harbor water into potable, fresh water.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ocean Pure Water System uses modern and proven water desalination processes in a new innovative way to reduce power consumption and upfront costs, while maximizing water production.  The systemâ€™s viability comes from using a technology that has been employed in the water industry for decades. Using desalination and purification techniques based on reverse osmosis (RO), the OPWS does not innovate on the removal of dissolved solids, but on the ability to supply water to the system.  The outcome of the OPWS is that it drastically reduces the significant costs associated with desalinating, purifying, and pumping to the surface fresh water, from major water sources such as: oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, ponds and aquifer. And due to the OPWSâ€™s modularity, the system is rapidly scalable to provide any amount of water desired. Many public and private sector executives, elected officials and their representatives will be on hand for this demonstration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in Boston in 2012, Phoenix Revolutionâ€™s mission is to overcome the most challenging problems that face our world today, through engineering economic and environmental solutions. Phoenix strives for the betterment of the worldwide community through innovative products that increase the quality of the earthâ€™s finite resources. To that end, our goal is to expand our ever-increasing range of products to benefit consumers and grow its place in the market, while producing dynamic solutions to problems on a global scale. Unlike many other promising technologies in this space, Phoenixâ€™s OPWS is market ready and scalable, ready to be used today, at a fraction of the cost of conceptual periphery technologies, which positions Phoenix to be able to solve the global water crisis today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For additional information about Phoenix Revolution Inc., please contact Chief Operating Officer Sean Goodwin at: 617-784-8283 or <a href="mailto:sean@phoenixrevolutioninc.com">sean@phoenixrevolutioninc.com</a> or check the Phoenix Revolution website at <a href="http://www.phoenixrevolutioninc.com">Phoenix Revolution Inc.

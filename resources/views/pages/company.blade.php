					<h3>Why we care about water, climate change, and a sustainable Earth</h3>
					<p>
						We at Phoenix Revolution propose an innovative solution. We propose that business goals should support and coincide with community aims. Our goal is to provide simple solutions to chronic problems; to provide clean water in the wake of shortages, improve the quality of the air we breathe, along with reaching out to communities to answer the age-old question, “What can we do to help?” We plan to catalyze the environmental movement and bring new innovative products to market that focus on helping to improve life worldwide. We want the future to be filled with global opportunities, the way we always dreamed it would be. Today, the problems we must face are daunting, but together we can shape a future where we are able to look back and say we left the planet better than we found it.

					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>

					</p>
					<p>
						The Ocean Pure Water System (OPWS) uses modern and proven water desalination processes in an innovative way to reduce power consumption and upfront costs, while maximizing water production.  The system’s viability comes from using a technology that has been employed in the water industry for decades. Using desalination and purification techniques based on reverse osmosis (RO), the OPWS does not innovate on the removal of dissolved solids, but on the ability to supply water to the system.  The outcome of the OPWS is that it drastically reduces  the significant costs associated with desalinating, purifying, and pumping to the surface fresh water, from major water sources such as: oceans, seas, rivers, and aquifers etc.
					</p>
					<p>

					</p>
					<p>
						The OPWS uses an RO membrane for the desalination and purification process. While the effectiveness and efficiency of the RO process has changed over decades of use, the core concept of how water is desalinated and purified has remained the same. RO systems use reverse osmosis to separate water molecules from their dissolved solids.  RO membranes are a chemically-treated barrier that only allows certain chemical formations to pass through. This wall has seen innovations throughout the years leading to the current membranes, which employ a three-layered system. The first layer is highly-selective, tightly-bound and chemically-treated, so that only one chemical formation can pass through the barrier. This layer requires high amounts of pressure to push molecules through the layer, which is only 0.2 microns thick. The next two layers reduce the selectivity in favor of rates of osmosis and stability, so the membrane can withstand higher pressures.
					</p>
					<p>
						When applied to water desalination and purification, these systems are chemically treated to allow water (H2O) molecules to pass through the barrier while molecules like salt, iron, and other dissolved solids cannot pass the highly selective layer, thus separating water from its dissolved solids as waste.  The only requirement is high pressure to overcome the natural osmosis threshold so the salt water can pass through the barrier; the higher the pressure, the more efficient the separation. In RO systems, the more pressure you can apply to the system, the higher the percentage of water that can pass through the membrane.
					</p>
					<p>
						Phoenix’s Patent Pending system revolutionizes this process by utilizing a wholly new method of supplying water to the desalinization process, resulting in a drastically reduced operational cost to any individual or entity seeking to produce potable water.The OPWS also utilizes an environmentally friendly post treatment  system that allows the OPWS to release salt water back out to the ocean without increasing the surrounding salinity past EPA limits.    This dramatic reduction in desalinization process cost will have a major global impact on the affordability and access to fresh water, which is currently regarded as a worldwide crisis.

					</p>

						The OPWS was designed to be a modular system. A system that can produced the same way millions of times to reduce the upfront cost of each system. This production works in conjunction with our over all design of the HLF.  We can produce in large quantities single OPWS units that then inter lock with each other as shown. The first group shown is called a OPWS Cluster Group (OCG)

						These simple group around the honeycomb formation allows the OPWS to achieve greater flow rates than an single unit could produce. This also allows for very standard part and simplification of the OPWS HLF which means shorter construction time, lower upfront cost, and replacement parts are easily available.
